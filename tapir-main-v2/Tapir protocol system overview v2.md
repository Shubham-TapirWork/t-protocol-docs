## Overview

Tapir protocol is a depeg protection marketplace. 
It allows users to derisk their defi investment or earn additional yield by either buying or selling the depeg protection. Our unique competitive advantage is that both the depeg protection buyers and sellers keep the full yield of the underlying protocol. This is something no other similar solution can offer and makes Tapir best suited for integrating with high yield protocols. 

## USP - unique selling proposition

No one has been able to offer protection for the high yield assets. 
The reason is simple, the protection sellers are undergoing the same risk as if they were holding the risk asset, but leaving all the juicy yield on the table. Tapir is unique in preserving the base yield for both the buyers & sellers.

**Investors can buy protection against depegs**  
Tapir allows investors to buy or sell depeg protection against losses caused by events like hacks or slashings. This feature lets some investors earn extra by selling protection, while others sleep easier knowing they are covered. It addresses the challenge of balancing high yields with complex DeFi risks.

**Investors can further boost their yield**  
Beyond benefiting from standard yields, investors can sell depeg protection to earn additional premiums, effectively acting as underwriters. This creates new revenue streams and yield-enhancement opportunities not available in traditional investing methods.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

Tapir will first target investors within the pendle ecosystem. This seems like the best protocol to integrate with, due the high fix yield yield that is being offered on the its assets, where the highest yield ones are usually the newest & most risky ones. Also Pendle offers many assets from many different underlying protocols, so by integrating with them we effectively allow user to participate in all the different protocols that Pendle integrates, without the need of integrating them directly. 

## Token Incentives Strategy

Tapir will reward early participants who provide initial liquidity and help reach Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) targets. By distributing native tokens to early investors, the protocol aligns incentives and encourages long-term commitment. Each round of incentives will have PCV milestones, ensuring measured growth. A lockup period may prevent rapid token churn, maintaining sustainable tokenomics. Over time, this controlled issuance supports stronger capital efficiency and appeal to other DeFi protocols.
