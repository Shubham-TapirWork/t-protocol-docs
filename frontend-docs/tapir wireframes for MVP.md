# tapir wireframes for MVP

https://hackmd.io/@WsWACVT3QOy5_gRc2Z3ZGg/S1iUd3PWJl


## Stake page - demo.tapir.money

#### functionality 

- investors need 
    - lido.fi has
        - buy tETH for ETH 
        - wrap tETH for wtETH 
    - we need to implement 3 staking modes
    - 
- MVP UI
    - for Desktop is sufficient 


#### wireframes 

##### 1st staking page - demo.tapir.money
this page should follow similar layout like https://lido.fi/. 

It should include logo on the left, 3 buttons with texts on the right (see texts below).  

###### functional difference
- three staking buttons instead of one that lido uses, after clicking, it takes user to **2nd staking page **

##### 2nd staking page demo.tapir.money/(restake-protection/yield-boost/regular)

this page should follow similar layout like https://stake.lido.fi/

It should include text on top (saying which staking it is), APR under and the staking button.
It should follow the color schema of the staking mode user clicks  

###### functional difference
- no added functionality on the page 
- we need 3 pages instead of one, one for each type of staking
